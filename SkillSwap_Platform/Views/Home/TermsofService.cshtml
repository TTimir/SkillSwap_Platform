Tokens may be purchased via our approved payment methods, including credit/debit cards and authorized third-party payment processors. All token purchases are final and non-refundable unless otherwise specified in these Terms or required by applicable law.

                                <p class="mb25 text fz15">To cancel a booked session and receive a refund of tokens, you must do so at least twenty-four (24) hours before the scheduled start time. If you cancel less than 24 hours in advance, you will forfeit the tokens unless the tutor consents to a refund. In the event of a tutor-initiated cancellation, you will receive a full token refund automatically. All refund requests must be submitted through the platform’s cancellation interface. Refunds will be issued in tokens and reflected in your account within 48 hours.</p>
